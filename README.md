# Fujitsu Compiler Test Suite


This repository contains a test suite for C/C++/Fortran compilers developed by Fujitsu.

This test suite was originally developed for the proprietary Fujitsu C/C++/Fortran compilers. We would like to contribute it to [the LLVM community](https://llvm.org/) to advance the quality of Clang/Flang/LLVM. The LLVM community has [its own test suite](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-test-suite/). We plan to join this effort, but it may take time to have consensus in the community on how to integrate. To make the community able to reach our test suite early, we release it in this repository as "Fujitsu Compiler Test Suite".

## Target Platform

Most test programs in this test suite will be able to run on many platforms (OS/CPU). However, because it was originally developed for Fujitsu C/C++/Fortran compilers, which target Linux/AArch64, it may contain test programs which don't run on platforms other than Linux/AArch64.

## How to Use

Please read [RUN.md](RUN.md) to use this test suite.

## Known Issues

Please see [KnownIssues Wiki page](https://github.com/fujitsu/compiler-test-suite/wiki/KnownIssues) for known issues.

## Known Issues and Future Plans

As of the 2025-08 release, the Fujitsu Compiler Test Suite lacks following things. They will be available in the upcoming releases.

- Addition of C/C++/Fortran test programs
- Many missing reference output files (used to verify outputs from test programs)
- Some tests have excessively long execution times
- Some tests consume large amounts of disk space
